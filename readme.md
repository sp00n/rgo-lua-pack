# Package containing Lua 5.3, lua-zlib, lua-lfs

This package contains the following, as windows binaries / dlls:
* [Lua 5.3](http://www.lua.org/download.html)
* [lua-zlib](https://github.com/brimworks/lua-zlib)
* [lua-lfs](https://github.com/keplerproject/luafilesystem)


It was originally created by [hhrhhr](https://github.com/hhrhhr), I just uploaded it to Github for easier access.  
It's intended to be used with the [rgo-lua-utils](https://github.com/sp00n/rgo-lua-utils), but can of course also be used for any other Lua project.
