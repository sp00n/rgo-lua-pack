# Package containing Lua 5.3, lua-zlib, lua-lfs

This package contains the following, as windows binaries / dlls:
* [Lua 5.3](http://www.lua.org/download.html)
* [lua-zlib](https://github.com/brimworks/lua-zlib)
* [lua-lfs](https://github.com/keplerproject/luafilesystem)


It was originally created by [hhrhhr](https://github.com/hhrhhr), I just uploaded it to Github for easier access.  
It's intended to be used with the [rgo-lua-utils](https://github.com/sp00n/rgo-lua-utils), but can of course also be used for any other Lua project.  


## Installation
The files should be extracted into a directory that is globally reachable, i.e. one that is present in your `PATH` variable.  
If you don't know what that is or how to add to it, here are some links that might help you (note that I have no affiliation with these whatsoever):
